          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
              myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.

            <h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
            <p>
                myFlix was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve is to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <section>
      <h4>Server side</h4>
      <p>
        Since this was meant to be a fullstack app, i first wrote the server side so that once i begin coding the client side, I will have an api to communicate with the backend and retrieve neccesary data. The sever side was written in Node Js, Express Js and mongo DB for the database.The server side was divided into three main atsks. Firstly to define to the endpoints for HTTP requests. Secondly to add add features to the endpoints such as user  authentication and validation. Finally to add the business logic through which the endpoint wil be connected to the database. Postman was used to test the server side api.<br>

      <h4>Client-side</h4>
      <p>
        I developed the client side consume the server side api so that users can interact with the app, view all the movie, click the respective buttons to view additional information about the movies like synopsis, director's details and genre. Users could also add movies to their list of favourites, eidt and even deete their user accounts. I used React JS, React-Redux React-boostrap to develope this project. below are images of some of the interfaces users could interact with.
